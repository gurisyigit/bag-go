## Project Overview
**Bag & Go** is a self-checkout web app designed for stores, eliminating the need for staff and relying solely on CCTV for security. Users can register, verify their identity, scan items via QR codes, and manage their purchases through a prepaid balance system. Admins can manage products, including discounted items, through a dedicated admin interface.
